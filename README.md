The code, executed with a fixed redshift (z), constructs a cubic representation of the universe. Here, the x and y axes mirror the vast expanse of the sky in light-years, while the z-axis encapsulates the redshift parameter. The center of this cube embodies the specified redshift value, offering a snapshot of the universe at a particular cosmic epoch.

Within this cubic canvas, the code gives us the motions of neutral hydrogen, tracing the evolution of 21cm radiation. The simulation encapsulates the interplay between cosmic expansion, gravity, and the intricate dance of matter. As the code iterates through the simulated universe, it provides a dynamic visualization of how cosmic structures evolve, influenced by the fundamental cosmological parameters.
